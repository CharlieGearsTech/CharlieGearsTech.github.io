# Introduction

Cybersecurity is any collection of mechanisms and processes to protect a system from malicious attacks. Notice that this concept is different from Functional Safety which  the syste has mechanisms to protects itself and the user from own systematic failures.

The principal goals for Autosar Cybersecurity are:

* Authenticity, the determination than the entity sending data is the one expected.
* Confidentiality ensures that communication between 2 entities cannot be intercepted by a third one.
* Integrity ensures that data received by one entity was not modified by another entity during the transmission.
* Availability ensures that one entity keeps its stable state during malicious attacks.
